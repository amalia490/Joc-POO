# Minion Fruit Chase - OOP C++ Game
---
## Description:
A simple console-based C++ using SFML game where a Minion navigates a maze, eats fruits, and avoids walls. The goal is to collect fruits while using arrow-key-style controls. The game uses key OOP principles for clean structure and modularity. SFML handles rendering, input, and graphics, bringing the game to life with a simple 2D interface.
